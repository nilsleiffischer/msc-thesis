abstract = {We formulate a general framework for describing the electromagnetic properties of spacetime. These properties are encoded in the `constitutive tensor of the vacuum', a quantity analogous to that used in the description of material media. We give a generally covariant derivation of the Fresnel equation describing the local properties of the propagation of electromagnetic waves for the case of the most general possible linear constitutive tensor. We also study the particular case in which a light cone structure is induced and the circumstances under which such a structure emerges. In particular, we will study the relationship between the dual operators defined by the constitutive tensor under certain conditions and the existence of a conformal metric. Closure and symmetry of the constitutive tensor will be found as conditions which ensure the existence of a conformal metric. We will also see how the metric components can be explicitly deduced from the constitutive tensor if these two conditions are met. Finally, we will apply the same method to explore the consequences of relaxing the condition of symmetry and how this affects the emergence of the light cone.},

abstract = {Forecasts in cosmology, both with Monte-Carlo Markov-chain methods and with the Fisher matrix formalism, depend on the choice of the fiducial model because both the signal strength of any observable as well as the model nonlinearities linking observables to cosmological parameters vary in the general case. In this paper we propose a method for extrapolating Fisher-forecasts across the space of cosmological parameters by constructing a suitable ba- sis. We demonstrate the validity of our method with constraints on a standard dark energy model extrapolated from a {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}}CDM-model, as can be expected from 2-bin weak lensing to- mography with a Euclid-like survey, in the parameter pairs {\$}(\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}},\backslashsigma{\_}8){\$}, {\$}(\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}, w{\_}0){\$} and {\$}(w{\_}0, w{\_}\backslashtext{\{}a{\}}){\$}. Our numerical results include very accurate extrapolations across a wide range of cosmo- logical parameters in terms of shape, size and orientation of the parameter likelihood, and a decomposition of the change of the likelihood contours into modes, which are straightforward to interpret in a geometrical way. We find that in particular the variation of the dark energy figure of merit is well captured by our formalism.},

abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14{\~{}}May 2009 and scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12{\~{}}August 2009 and 23{\~{}}October 2013. In February{\~{}}2015, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire Planck mission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the data products in the release, as well as the associated cosmological and astrophysical science results and papers. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues of Sunyaev-Zeldovich clusters and Galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulations of signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methods and assessment of uncertainties. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data are described, as well as a CMB lensing likelihood. Scientific results include cosmological parameters deriving from CMB power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well as constraints on inflation, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, dark energy, and modified gravity.},

The problem of estimating the acceleration vector from a magnitude-limited redshift survey and the anisotropy of the galaxy clustering patterns are studied, restricting attention to large scales for which linear theory should be applicable. The determination of the density parameter from the Galaxy's infall to the local supercluster is addressed, and the influence of peculiar velocities on the morphology of clustering in the transition between the linear and nonlinear regimes is investigated.},

abstract = {We analyze the anisotropic clustering of massive galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) sample, which consists of 264,283 galaxies in the redshift range 0.43 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7 spanning 3,275 square degrees. Both peculiar velocities and errors in the assumed redshift-distance relation ("Alcock-Paczynski effect") generate correlations between clustering amplitude and orientation with respect to the line-of-sight. Together with the sharp baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) standard ruler, our measurements of the broadband shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions simultaneously constrain the comoving angular diameter distance (2190 +/- 61 Mpc) to z=0.57, the Hubble expansion rate at z=0.57 (92.4 +/- 4.5 km/s/Mpc), and the growth rate of structure at that same redshift (d sigma8/d ln a = 0.43 +/- 0.069). Our analysis provides the best current direct determination of both DA and H in galaxy clustering data using this technique. If we further assume a LCDM expansion history, our growth constraint tightens to d sigma8/d ln a = 0.415 +/- 0.034. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our measurements of DA, H, and growth all separately require dark energy at z {\textgreater} 0.57, and when combined imply $\backslash$Omega{\_}{\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} = 0.74 +/- 0.016, independent of the Universe's evolution at z{\textless}0.57.

abstract = {The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta. Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of dynamical ejecta mass range between {\$}M{\_}{\{}ej{\}} = 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} for various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if {\$}\backslashgtrsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} of the matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements, GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process material observed in the Milky Way.},

abstract = {The Etherington distance duality relation, which relates the luminosity distance, the angular diameter distance and the redshift of objects, depends only upon a conservation law for light that traces back directly to the Lorentzian spacetime geometry. We show that this duality relation indeed survives transition to the most general linear electrodynamics without birefringence, which rests on a spacetime geometry constituted by a Lorentzian metric and two scalar fields, a dilaton and an axion. By computing the Poynting vector and optical scalar transport in the geometrical optics limit of this framework, we derive the modification of the light flux in the presence of a dilaton field and present improved constraints on the gradient of the dilaton field from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum. Although this flux modification may seem applicable also to fundamental modifications of the Etherington relation, we show that the distance duality relation still holds true. Thus any deviations within this classical theory would imply non-metricities, once astrophysical sources for attenuation, such as dust, are accounted for. Moreover, using the most up-to-date measurements of the luminosity distances to Supernovae of Type Ia, and the inferred angular diameter distances from the baryon acoustic feature measurements, we perform a scale-free and nearly model-independent test of the Etherington distance duality relation between redshifts of {\$}0.38{\$} and {\$}0.61{\$}. We find consistency with the standard distance duality relation and constrain the optical depth of light between these two redshifts to {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashtau=-0.006\backslashpm0.046{\$}.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that the cosmological constant {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} might be measured from geometric effects on large-scale structure. A positive vacuum density leads to correlation-function contours which are squashed in the radial direction when calculated assuming a matter-dominated model. We show that this effect will be somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations have suggested: the squashing factor is likely to be {\$}{\textless}1.3{\$}, given realistic constraints on the matter contribution to {\$}\backslashOmega{\$}. Moreover, the geometrical distortion risks being confused with the redshift-space distortions caused by the peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy clustering. These depend on the density and bias parameters via the combination {\$}\backslashbeta\backslashequiv \backslashOmega{\^{}}{\{}0.6{\}}/b{\$}, and we show that the main practical effect of a geometrical flattening factor {\$}F{\$} is to simulate gravitational instability with {\$}\backslashbeta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}\backslashsimeq 0.5(F-1){\$}. Nevertheless, with datasets of sufficient size it is possible to distinguish the two effects; we discuss in detail how this should be done. New-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars are potentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density, if it exists at a cosmologically interesting level.},

abstract = {String backgrounds and D-branes do not possess the structure of Lorentzian manifolds, but that of manifolds with area metric. Area metric geometry is a true generalization of metric geometry, which in particular may accommodate a B-field. While an area metric does not determine a connection, we identify the appropriate differential geometric structure which is of relevance for the minimal surface equation in such a generalized geometry. In particular the notion of a derivative action of areas on areas emerges naturally. Area metric geometry provides new tools in differential geometry, which promise to play a role in the description of gravitational dynamics on D-branes.},

abstract = {We present a new method of constructing a stress-energy-momentum tensor for a classical field theory based on covariance considerations and Noether theory. The stress-energy-momentum tensor T {\^{}}$\mu$ {\_}$\nu$ that we construct is defined using the (multi)momentum map associated to the spacetime diffeomorphism group. The tensor T {\^{}}$\mu$ {\_}$\nu$ is uniquely determined as well as gauge-covariant, and depends only upon the divergence equivalence class of the Lagrangian. It satisfies a generalized version of the classical Belinfante-Rosenfeld formula, and hence naturally incorporates both the canonical stress-energy-momentum tensor and the “correction terms” that are necessary to make the latter well behaved. Furthermore, in the presence of a metric on spacetime, our T{\^{}}($\mu$$\nu$) coincides with the Hilbert tensor and hence is automatically symmetric.},

Restricting attention to canonically quantizable matter field equations, but therefore being able to admit any tensorial background geometry, one is left with very little choice for the dynamics of the geometry. Indeed, the physical requirement that the common canonical evolution of matter and geometry can start and end on shared Cauchy surfaces imposes consistency conditions so strong that the Lagrangian for the geometry arises as the solution of a particular system of linear partial differential equations. Through these equations, the Lagrangian for the geometry is thus determined by the stipulated matter field dynamics. In contrast to previous work, we now build the theory on a suitable associated bundle encoding the canonical configuration degrees of freedom, which allows to include necessary constraints on the geometry in practically tractable fashion.},

abstract = {There is a general belief, reinforced by statements in standard textbooks, that: (i) one can obtain the full non-linear Einstein's theory of gravity by coupling a massless, spin-2 field {\$}h{\_}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} self-consistently to the total energy momentum tensor, including its own; (ii) this procedure is unique and leads to Einstein-Hilbert action and (iii) it only uses standard concepts in Lorentz invariant field theory and does not involve any geometrical assumptions. After providing several reasons why such beliefs are suspect -- and critically re-examining several previous attempts -- we provide a detailed analysis aimed at clarifying the situation. First, we prove that it is $\backslash$textit{\{}impossible{\}} to obtain the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action, starting from the standard action for gravitons in linear theory and iterating repeatedly. Second, we use the Taylor series expansion of the action for Einstein's theory, to identify the tensor {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}S{\}}{\^{}}{\{}ab{\}}{\$}, to which the graviton field {\$}h{\_}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} couples to the lowest order. We show that the second rank tensor {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}S{\}}{\^{}}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} is {\{}$\backslash$it not{\}} the conventional energy momentum tensor {\$}T{\^{}}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} of the graviton and provide an explanation for this feature. Third, we construct the full nonlinear Einstein's theory with the source being spin-0 field, spin-1 field or relativistic particles by explicitly coupling the spin-2 field to this second rank tensor {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}S{\}}{\^{}}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} order by order and summing up the infinite series. Finally, we construct the theory obtained by self consistently coupling {\$}h{\_}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} to the conventional energy momentum tensor {\$}T{\^{}}{\{}ab{\}}{\$} order by order and show that this does {\{}$\backslash$it not{\}} lead to Einstein's theory.

abstract = {The clustering of galaxies observed in future redshift surveys will provide a wealth of cosmological information. Matching the signal at different redshifts constrains the dark energy driving the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe. In tandem with these geometrical constraints, redshift-space distortions (RSD) depend on the build up of large-scale structure. As pointed out by many authors measurements of these effects are intrinsically coupled. We investigate this link, and argue that it strongly depends on the cosmological assumptions adopted when analysing data. Using representative assumptions for the parameters of the "Euclid" survey in order to provide a baseline future experiment, we show how the derived constraints change due to different model assumptions. We argue that even the assumption of a Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time is sufficient to reduce the importance of the coupling to a significant degree. Taking this idea further, we consider how the data would actually be analysed and argue that we should not expect to be able to simultaneously constrain multiple deviations from the standard {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model. We therefore consider different possible ways in which the Universe could deviate from the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, and show how the coupling between geometrical constraints and structure growth affects the measurement of such deviations.},

This includes an identification of the timelike future cones and their duals associated to an area metric geometry, and thus paves the ground for a discussion of the related local and global causal structures in standard fashion. In order to provide simple algebraic criteria for an area metric manifold to present a consistent spacetime structure, we develop a complete algebraic classification of area metric tensors up to general transformations of frame.

abstract = {We present an impact of coupling between dark matter and a scalar field, which might be responsible for dark energy, on measurements of redshift-space distortions. We point out that, in the presence of conformal and/or disformal coupling, linearized continuity and Euler equations for total matter fluid significantly deviate from the standard ones even in the sub-horizon scales. In such a case, a peculiar velocity of total matter field is determined not only by a logarithmic time derivative of its density perturbation but also by density perturbations for both dark matter and baryon, leading to a large modification of the physical interpretation of observed data obtained by measurements of redshift-space distortions. We reformulate galaxy two-point correlation function in the redshift space based on the modified continuity and Euler equations. We conclude from the resultant formula that the true value of the linear growth rate of large-scale structure cannot be necessarily constrained by single-redshift measurements of the redshift-space distortions, unless one observes the actual time-evolution of structure.},

abstract = {Subject of this paper are intrinsic ellipticity correlations between galaxies, their statistical properties, their observability with future surveys and their interference with weak gravitational lensing measurements. Using an angular momentum-based, quadratic intrinsic alignment model we derive correlation functions of the ellipticity components and project them to yield the four non-zero angular ellipticity spectra {\$}C{\^{}}\backslashepsilon{\_}E(\backslashell){\$}, {\$}C{\^{}}\backslashepsilon{\_}B(\backslashell){\$}, {\$}C{\^{}}\backslashepsilon{\_}C(\backslashell){\$} and {\$}C{\^{}}\backslashepsilon{\_}S(\backslashell){\$} in their generalisation to tomographic surveys. For a Euclid-like survey, these spectra would have amplitudes smaller than the weak lensing effect on nonlinear structures, but would constitute an important systematic. Computing estimation biases for cosmological parameters derived from an alignment-contaminated survey suggests biases of {\$}+5\backslashsigma{\_}w{\$} for the dark energy equation of state parameter {\$}w{\$}, {\$}-20\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\}}{\$} for the matter density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and {\$}-12\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\}}{\$} for the spectrum normalisation {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8{\$}. Intrinsic alignments yield a signal which is easily observable with a survey similar to Euclid: While not independent, significances for estimates of each of the four spectra reach values of tens of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} if weak lensing and shape noise are considered as noise sources, which suggests relative uncertainties on alignment parameters at the percent level.},

@article{Sellentin2015,
abstract = {Assuming a Euclid-like weak lensing data set, we compare different methods of dealing with its inherent parameter degeneracies. Including priors into a data analysis can mask the information content of a given data set alone. However, since the information content of a data set is usually estimated with the Fisher matrix, priors are added in order to enforce an approximately Gaussian likelihood. Here, we compare priorless forecasts to more conventional forecasts that use priors. We find strongly non-Gaussian likelihoods for 2d-weak lensing if no priors are used, which we approximate with the DALI-expansion. Without priors, the Fisher matrix of the 2d-weak lensing likelihood includes unphysical values of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and {\$}h{\$}, since it does not capture the shape of the likelihood well. The Cramer-Rao inequality then does not need to apply. We find that DALI and Monte Carlo Markov Chains predict the presence of a dark energy with high significance, whereas a Fisher forecast of the same data set also allows decelerated expansion. We also find that a 2d-weak lensing analysis provides a sharp lower limit on the Hubble constant of {\$}h {\textgreater} 0.4{\$}, even if the equation of state of dark energy is jointly constrained by the data. This is not predicted by the Fisher matrix and usually masked in other works by a sharp prior on {\$}h{\$}. Additionally, we find that DALI estimates Figures of Merit in the presence of non-Gaussianities better than the Fisher matrix. We additionally demonstrate how DALI allows switching to a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of a highly curved likelihood with acceptance rates of {\$}\backslashapprox 0.5{\$}, an effective covering of the parameter space, and numerically effectively costless leapfrog steps. This shows how quick forecasts can be upgraded to accurate forecasts whenever needed. Results were gained with the public code from http://lnasellentin.github.io/DALI/},

abstract = {We construct the differential geometry of smooth manifolds equipped with an algebraic curvature map acting as an area measure. Area metric geometry provides a spacetime structure suitable for the discussion of gauge theories and strings, and is considerably more general than Lorentzian geometry. Our construction of geometrically relevant objects, such as an area metric compatible connection and derived tensors, makes essential use of a decomposition theorem due to Gilkey, whereby we generate the area metric from a finite collection of metrics. Employing curvature invariants for multi-metric backgrounds we devise a class of gravity theories with inherently stringy character, and discuss gauge matter actions.},

abstract = {We study Modified Gravity (MG) theories by modelling the redshifted matter power spectrum in a spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB) basis. We use a fully non-linear description of the real-space matter power-spectrum and include the lowest-order redshift-space correction (Kaiser effect), taking into account some additional non-linear contributions. Ignoring relativistic corrections, which are not expected to play an important role for a shallow survey, we analyse two different modified gravity scenarios, namely the generalised Dilaton scalar-tensor theories and the {\$}f({\{}R{\}}){\$} models in the large curvature regime. We compute the 3D power spectrum {\$}{\{}\backslashcal C{\}}{\^{}}s{\_}{\{}\backslashell{\}}(k{\_}1,k{\_}2){\$} for various such MG theories with and without redshift space distortions, assuming precise knowledge of background cosmological parameters. Using an all-sky spectroscopic survey with Gaussian selection function {\$}\backslashvarphi(r)\backslashpropto \backslashexp(-{\{}r{\^{}}2 / r{\^{}}2{\_}0{\}}){\$}, {\$}r{\_}0 = 150 \backslash, h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} \backslash, {\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\}}{\$}, and number density of galaxies {\$}\backslashbar {\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}N{\}}{\}} =10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}\backslash;{\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, we use a {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} analysis, and find that the lower-order {\$}(\backslashell \backslashleq 25){\$} multipoles of {\$}{\{}\backslashcal C{\}}{\^{}}s{\_}\backslashell(k,k'){\$} (with radial modes restricted to {\$}k {\textless} 0.2 \backslash, h \backslash,{\{}\backslashtextrm{\{}Mpc{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) can constraint the parameter {\$}f{\_}{\{}R{\_}0{\}}{\$} at a level of {\$}2\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} (3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}){\$} with {\$}3 \backslashsigma{\$} confidence for {\$}n=1(2){\$}. Combining constraints from higher {\$}\backslashell {\textgreater} 25{\$} modes can further reduce the error bars and thus in principle make cosmological gravity constraints competitive with solar system tests. However this will require an accurate modelling of non-linear redshift space distortions. Using a tomographic {\$}\backslashbeta(a){\$}-{\$}m(a){\$} parameterization we also derive constraints on specific parameters describing the Dilaton models of modified gravity.},
