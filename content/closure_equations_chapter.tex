\chapter{The gravitational closure equations}\label{sec:closure_eqns}

The publication~\autocite{Schuller2016} develops the gravitational closure equations that are reprinted below. It is a set of countably many partial differential equations in the variables~$\geomdof^A$ and their derivates by spatial variables as detailed in \autoref{sec:solve_closeqns}. The \emph{kinematical coefficients}, highlighted in red, serve as input to this set of equations. They are computed from the provided matter field equations as specified in~\autocite{Schuller2016}. We compute them explicitly for metric and area-metric cosmology in \autoref{sec:solve_closeqns}. Then, the closure equations solve for the \emph{dynamical coefficients}, highlighted in blue, that constitute expansion coefficients of the gravity action~\eqref{eq:geom_action_expansion}.

\autoref{fig:CE_full} visualizes the structure of this set of equations in their full generality. \autoref{fig:CE_cosmo} shows their structure under cosmological symmetries.
